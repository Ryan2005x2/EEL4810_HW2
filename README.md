1. Deep Neural Network: Here you will find the Source Code, AKA Training and Validation Script. This program has the baseline configurations.
2. Experimental Analysis: Here you will find different possible configurations and their effects on the training and validation losses and accuracies per epoch (up to 100). These
   configuration changes are being compared to the baseline (Source Code), so changes (if any) in code will be noted in detail.
